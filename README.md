Using Azure to Build a Whole Data Engineering Pipeline ‚ú® In this blog, I outline a comprehensive process for utilizing Azure's strong ecosystem to develop a complete end-to-end (E2E) data engineering solution. The project uses important Azure services like Azure Data Factory, Azure Databricks, Azure Synapse Analytics, and Power BI to process, convert, and deliver data for Business Intelligence (BI) objectives. The AdventureWorks dataset, which can be obtained straight from GitHub, is the source of the data. An outline of the solution architecture is provided here:

üìå Project Objective The goal of this project is to develop a scalable, secure, and efficient data pipeline that:

Ingests data from external sources
Performs data transformation and cleaning using PySpark
Stores the processed data in a structured format for seamless analysis
Supports interactive and insightful visualizations to drive informed decision-making

Step 1: Setting Up the Azure Environment ‚öôÔ∏è The first step involves provisioning the necessary Azure services to support the data pipeline:

Azure Data Factory (ADF): Orchestrates and automates data workflows.
Azure Storage Account: Serves as the data lake, organized into three layers‚Äîraw (bronze), transformed (silver), and curated (gold).
Azure Databricks: Handles data transformation and computation using PySpark.
Azure Synapse Analytics: Functions as the data warehouse, enabling fast querying and BI integration.
Each resource was configured with appropriate Identity and Access Management (IAM) roles to ensure secure and seamless connectivity across the environment.

Step 2: Implementing the Data Pipeline Using ADF üöÄ Azure Data Factory (ADF) acts as the central orchestrator for the entire data pipeline.

Dynamic Copy Activity: ADF uses an HTTP connector to fetch data directly from GitHub and loads it into the bronze layer of the Azure Storage Account.

Parameterized Pipeline: Parameters were incorporated into the pipeline design, allowing flexibility and easy adaptation to changes in the data source or file structure.

This setup ensures a reusable and scalable approach to data ingestion.
