Using Azure to Build a Whole Data Engineering Pipeline ‚ú® In this Projects, I outline a comprehensive process for utilizing Azure's strong ecosystem to develop a complete end-to-end (E2E) data engineering solution. The project uses important Azure services like Azure Data Factory, Azure Databricks, Azure Synapse Analytics, and Power BI to process, convert, and deliver data for Business Intelligence (BI) objectives. The AdventureWorks dataset, which can be obtained straight from GitHub, is the source of the data. An outline of the solution architecture is provided here:

üìå Project Objective The goal of this project is to develop a scalable, secure, and efficient data pipeline that:

Ingests data from external sources
Performs data transformation and cleaning using PySpark
Stores the processed data in a structured format for seamless analysis
Supports interactive and insightful visualizations to drive informed decision-making

Step 1: Setting Up the Azure Environment ‚öôÔ∏è The first step involves provisioning the necessary Azure services to support the data pipeline:

Azure Data Factory (ADF): Orchestrates and automates data workflows.
Azure Storage Account: Serves as the data lake, organized into three layers‚Äîraw (bronze), transformed (silver), and curated (gold).
Azure Databricks: Handles data transformation and computation using PySpark.
Azure Synapse Analytics: Functions as the data warehouse, enabling fast querying and BI integration.
Each resource was configured with appropriate Identity and Access Management (IAM) roles to ensure secure and seamless connectivity across the environment.

Step 2: Implementing the Data Pipeline Using ADF üöÄ Azure Data Factory (ADF) acts as the central orchestrator for the entire data pipeline.

Dynamic Copy Activity: ADF uses an HTTP connector to fetch data directly from GitHub and loads it into the bronze layer of the Azure Storage Account.

Parameterized Pipeline: Parameters were incorporated into the pipeline design, allowing flexibility and easy adaptation to changes in the data source or file structure.

This setup ensures a reusable and scalable approach to data ingestion.

The raw data is now securely stored and ready for transformation.

Step 3: Data Transformation with Azure Databricks üîÑ Using Azure Databricks, the raw data from the bronze container was transformed into a structured format.

Key Steps: Cluster Setup: A Databricks cluster was created to process the data efficiently. Data Lake Integration: Databricks connected to Azure Storage to access the raw data.

Transformations: Normalized date formats for consistency.

Cleaned and filtered invalid or incomplete records.

Grouped and concatenated data to make it more usable for analysis.

Saved the transformed data in the silver container in Parquet format for optimal storage and query performance.

Step 4: Data Warehousing with Azure Synapse Analytics üìä Azure Synapse Analytics was utilized to structure the transformed data for efficient analysis and BI reporting.

Key Steps:

Connecting to the Silver Container: Synapse was configured to read data directly from the Azure Storage account‚Äôs silver layer.

Serverless SQL Pools: Used to run queries on the data without the need to provision or manage dedicated compute resources, enabling cost-effective, on-demand access.

Database and Schema Setup: Created SQL databases and schemas to logically organize the data for better manageability.

External Tables and Views: Defined external tables and created views to make the data easily consumable for reporting tools like Power BI.

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/4c3c86e4-d751-4d7f-aea0-13e68b77a133)

The cleaned, structured data was then moved to the gold container for reporting purposes.

Step 5: Business Intelligence Integration üïµÔ∏è‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è The final step involved integrating the data with a BI tool to visualize and generate insights.

Power BI Integration: Connected Power BI to Azure Synapse Analytics.

Designed dashboards and reports to present actionable insights to stakeholders.
